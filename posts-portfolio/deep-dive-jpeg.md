# Deep dive into JPEG
*19/01/2022*

This is my first video as an Art director and animator at [Reducible](https://www.youtube.com/c/Reducible), and I'm very excited to share it with the world.

In this one, we are going to explore the insights and perks of JPEG, one of the most *controversial* pieces of engineering ever created. 

For engineers and computer scientists, the invention of the algorithm just expels genious and massive brain energy: it is able to take only **some of the information** of any given image and remove it successfully, with no apparent effect on the final product â€” all while compressing said image to ratios as high as 5% of the original one. Even the criteria on what information to take out is insanely clever. 

But for most, JPEG is an infamous image format mostly known for **weird artifacts and bad quality**. In the internet and meme culture, it is used on purpose to create the usual vibe one expects for *deep fried, ultra saturated* memes, since the algorithm can really squash and destroy what you throw at it.

I hope that this video will give viewers a sense of what's being targeted and removed by JPEG, allowing for better decision making when choosing an image format, or even the "quality" settings that most photo editors allow. All this and much more is explained in here.

As always... here's the final product!
