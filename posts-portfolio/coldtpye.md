# Coldtype: the hottest typos 
*04/10/2021*

Yesterday I discovered this super cool python library called [Coldtype](https://coldtype.xyz), aimed at very specific and thorough typography manipulation, among other things. It is a little cryptic at first, but addictive at last.

Here are some of the little gifs I've done experimenting with it. Nothing planned. No phones in sight, just types, typos and typography.
