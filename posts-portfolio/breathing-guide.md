# Breathing Guide
*13/02/2022*

This sketch actually started as a quick study on how to draw organic shapes using lots of very small, varying sized circles. The final sketch is composed of a lot of happy accidents, like the big circle rotating offscreen.

It finally started to resemble this kind of gifs that help you breathe slowly and help with anxiety, so that is what I went for.
