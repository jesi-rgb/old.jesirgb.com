# Swifty Grid 
*12/02/2022*

I've been into creative programming since quite a long time now. I think the best "Hello World" in this discipline is generating terrain with simplex/perlin noise. That is what brought me into this field.

After a long pause, mainly due to focusing on finishing my degree and searching for a job, I am happy to come back. I find this activity to be incredibly satisfacting intelectually, while also being beautiful and flashy enough to engage other people into it.

Here, I present **Swifty Grid**, hosted in [Open Processing](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1492075). Here's a quick user manual:
- You can *click* the canvas to start/stop playning the animation
- You can *right-click* the canvas to save the frame you are currently in
- You can press *'0'* to come back to the initial frame
- You can press the *reload* button to generate another piece
